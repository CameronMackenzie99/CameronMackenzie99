### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [**student-loan-tracker**](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/student-loan-tracker) <img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white" />
	- A web app that calculates and tracks your student loan. ⚡ T3 stack, Next.js, Shadcn-ui, TailwindCSS 
### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **NextJS**
	- For student-loan-tracker project, with a mixture of server and client-side rendering.
- **Figma**
	- For creating quick mock-ups of screens
- **tRPC**
	- tRPC for end-to-end typesafety in API. Use with Zod for schema validation.
- **State Machines**
	- Xstate for finite state machines. State machines used at work so curious to explore in TS on top of C#.
## 🥅 Goals for 2023
- ✅ Deploy MVP of student loan tracker to users
- ✅ Learn about serverless deployment of web apps
- ♾️ Continue to learn new technologies
