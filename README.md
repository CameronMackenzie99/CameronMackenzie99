## About Me
### Hello, I'm Cameron! ðŸ‘‹
### I am a chemistry Master's graduate from the UK who is looking for a career in software engineering, using skills gained through my industrial Master's project as well as personal project-based learning.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator): Aims to emulate common online calculators for calculating tax and national insurance, but with more complex data visualisation, for example comparison to previous tax years, and net pay history over time.
  	 - Technologies: Python, with SQL databases in the works. Currently a CLU but aim to build a front end in the future and use Docker to containerise as web app for other users.
  - CS61A Computer Science Course: I am solidifying the foundations of computer science alongside my project-based learning.
  - [leetcode-solutions](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/leetcode-solutions/): Practice of basic leetcode problems to improve my understanding of data structures, time complexities and debugging.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
 	- Asynchronous programming: for using APIs to get data.
 	- SQL databases: for storing data in [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) project.
 	- TeX: My CV is built with the LaTeX macro package, which I learnt from an existing popular template which I have modified to suit my needs. Analysing and modifying existing code is one of my key self-directed learning methods.
 	- DevOps principles: CI/CD using GitHub Actions (used currently for linting code on push)
		- Will expand this to running tests when codebase grows for current project.

	- I am seeking a graduate role in the UK for any company with a passion for problem solving!

## Goals for 2021 ðŸ¥…
- Implement all core features of the take home pay calculator and learn how to containerise it for deployment to other users.
- Explore the vast array of technologies and career paths available in software engineering.
- Land a career job!
