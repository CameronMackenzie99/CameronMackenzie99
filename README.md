## About Me
### Hello, I'm Cameron! ðŸ‘‹
### I am a chemistry Master's graduate from the UK who is looking to apply the skills gained in my industrial computational Master's project to a career in software engineering.
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
     - A budget splitting web app for shared expenses tracking.
     		- Technologies: Python and SQL, currently a CLU but aim to build a front end in the future. Docker to containerise as web app for other users.
     		- I plan to increase the complexity of the implementation of the features as my skills improve.
     - [leetcode-solutions](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/leetcode-solutions/): Practice of basic leetcode problems to improve my understanding of data structures, time complexities and debugging. 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
 	- [Advanced Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-python): Collections module, comprehensions, lambda functions...
 	- TeX: My CV is built with the LaTeX macro package, which I learnt from an existing popular template which I have modified to suit my needs. Analysing and modifying existing code is one of my key self-directed learning methods.
 	- DevOps principles: CI/CD using GitHub Actions

## Goals for 2021 ðŸ¥…
- Implement all core features of the budget splitter app and learn how to containerise it for deployment to other users.
- Explore the vast array of technologies and career paths available in software engineering.
- Land a career job!
