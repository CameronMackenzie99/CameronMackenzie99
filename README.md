## About Me
### Hello, I'm Cameron! 👋
#### I am a chemistry Master's graduate pursuing a career in software/web development, building on skills gained through my industrial Master's project and degree. 

#### I strongly believe in project-based learning, and I would love to apply the skills I have gained to build something brilliant for a company with a passion for using technology to help people and society.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [**portfolio-website**](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/portfolio-website) 
	- A place to document my learning in the software world, and learn as I build!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **Serverless functions**
	- Fetching blog posts from CMS using netlify serverless functions.
- **Databases**
	- Storing configuration data for historic tax years in [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) project.
- **DevOps principles**
	- _Continuous Integration_ using GitHub Actions, [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) uses CI workflows to lint and test code. 
	- _Continuous Deployment_ of website, using pull requests to generate deploy previews for live testing, on top of local testing with netlify dev tools.
- **Cloud services**
	- Exposure to wider range of deployment solutions. Would like to use Vercel to deploy next full-stack project using Next.js, with a full backend to store and manage user data.

## 🥅 Goals for 2022
- ✔️ Land a career job!
- ✔️ Implement core features of the take home pay calculator.
- ✔️ Build front-end for web app.
- ✔️ Deploy web app to other users.
- ♾️ Continue to grow my technical skills and learn new technologies.
- ♾️ Refine my project planning and teamwork abilities with agile and SCRUM methodologies.
