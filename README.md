## About Me
### Hello, I'm Cameron! 👋
### A chemistry Master's graduate from the UK who is looking for a career in software engineering, using skills gained through my industrial Master's project as well as personal project-based learning.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [**take-home-pay-calculator**](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator): Aims to emulate common online calculators for calculating tax and national insurance, but with more complex data visualisation, for example comparison to previous tax years, and net pay history over time.
  	 - Technologies: Python, FastAPI. Currently a command line script in process of integrating FastAPI, and building a front end with React and using Docker to containerise as web app for deployment.
  - **CS61A Computer Science Course**: I am solidifying the foundations of computer science alongside my project-based learning.
  - [**leetcode-solutions**](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/leetcode-solutions/): Practice of leetcode problems to improve my understanding of data structures, time complexities and debugging. Use of Jest testing framework to validate javascript solutions and doctests for python solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
	- **FastAPI and React**: for deploying [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) as a web app with a frontend.
 	- **Javascript**: apply python knowledge to JS and TypeScript, to learn React and NodeJS.
	- **Asynchronous programming**: for interacting with APIs.
 	- **SQL databases**: for storing data in [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) project.
 	- **DevOps principles**: CI/CD using GitHub Actions, [take-home-pay-calculator](https://github.com/CameronMackenzie99/take-home-pay-calculator) uses CI workflows to lint and test code.
 	- **Environment management**: [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/#) combines virtual enviroment and package installation for easy management of dependencies.
	- **TeX**: My CV is built with the LaTeX macro package, which I learnt from an existing popular template which I have modified to suit my needs. Analysing and modifying existing code is one of my key self-directed learning methods.
